> A calmer way to watch. **Made to reduce YouTube addiction** — not feed it.

Chiku Tube is a distraction-free, AI-powered video discovery app. No
endless infinite scroll. No autoplay traps. No notifications screaming
for your attention. Just a clean player, hand-picked shelves, and a
"Continue Watching" row so you can finish the one video you came for and
**actually close the tab**.

## Why this exists

YouTube is brilliant at one thing: keeping you watching. Recommendations,
shorts, autoplay, banners, comments — every pixel is engineered to extend
session time.

Chiku Tube flips the goal:

- **Watch what you came for, leave when you're done.**
- No suggested rabbit holes after every video.
- No comments, no shorts, no live notifications.
- AI is used to *help you find one good thing*, not to keep you scrolling.
- Your watch history lives in *your browser* — no cross-device profile
  building, no ad targeting.

If you've ever opened YouTube to play one song and looked up an hour later
wondering where the time went, this is for you.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install
bun install     # or: npm install / pnpm install

# Run dev server (http://localhost:8080)
bun run dev

# Type-check + production build
bun run build

# Preview the build
bun run preview
```

### Environment

No secrets are required — Chiku Tube has no backend database, no
auth, and no analytics. Watch history and likes live in `localStorage`.

---

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Workers

`wrangler.jsonc` is preconfigured. Build then deploy:

```bash
bun run build
npx wrangler deploy
```

The build outputs an SSR worker plus static assets. Make sure the
`nodejs_compat` flag is enabled (already set in `wrangler.jsonc`).

### Vercel

`vercel.json` targets the Vercel adapter. Connect the repo on
[vercel.com](https://vercel.com), then:

```bash
bun run build:vercel
```

Vercel will run the same command on push.

### Self-host (Node)

```bash
bun run build
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

Any Node-18+ host works (Fly.io, Railway, your own VPS, a Raspberry Pi
on your home network).

### Docker (optional sketch)

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN bun run build

FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/.output ./.output
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", ".output/server/index.mjs"]
```

## Privacy & data

- **Watch history, likes, position memory** → `localStorage` only.
- **We Use Your ip address for showing content according to your language  but we don't save it **
- **No analytics, no trackers, no third-party scripts.**

You can wipe everything in one click via your browser's site-data
settings.
